## Retro

[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good

* We did good with learning the new technologies and languages required for making the project.

### Bad

* We could do better at planning out the project.
* We could do better at seperating out responsibilites and setting timelines for when they should be done throughout the group
* Communication could be better within the group.

### Actionable Commitments

* As a team, we will better plan out what each of us will work on. We will be better at meeting with each other to work on the project.

## Next Sprint Planning

We will need to start working on a UI design for the app. We need to finish setting up proper testing for our code.
