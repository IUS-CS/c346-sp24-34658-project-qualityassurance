Testing Strategy for Basic Goal Habit Tracker App

## Overview
In the development of the Basic Goal Habit Tracker app, we are committed to ensuring the quality and reliability of the codebase through comprehensive testing. Our testing approach combines unit testing, UI testing, and integration testing to validate the functionality and behavior of the app.

## Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Unit testing focuses on testing individual units of code in isolation to verify their correctness.
- **Tools**: We use XCTest framework in Xcode for writing and running unit tests.
- **Coverage**: Key components such as Habit, Goal, and Statistics models are extensively unit tested to validate their logic and functionality.
- **Expectations**: When examining our unit tests, you should expect to see tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases for each unit of code.

## UI Testing
- **Scope**: UI testing involves testing the user interface and user interactions to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Tools**: Xcode's UI Testing framework is utilized for writing UI tests that simulate user interactions.
- **Coverage**: UI tests are created to validate the navigation flow, button actions, and data display within the app.
- **Expectations**: When reviewing our UI tests, you can expect to see test cases that cover user interactions, screen transitions, and the correct rendering of UI elements.

## Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Integration testing evaluates the interactions and communication between different components of the app.
- **Tools**: XCTest framework is leveraged for integration testing to ensure the seamless integration of app components.
- **Coverage**: Integration test cases are designed to validate the end-to-end functionality of the app, including data flow and communication between views and models.
- **Expectations**: By examining our integration tests, you should expect to see tests that verify the collaboration between different modules and the overall behavior of the app.

## Conclusion
Our testing strategy for the  Goal Habit Tracker app is structured to ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of the codebase. By maintaining a robust testing suite that covers unit, UI, and integration testing, we aim to deliver a high-quality app that meets user expectations and provides a seamless experience.
