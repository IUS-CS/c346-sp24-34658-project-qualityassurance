# Architecture
Date: 3/19/24

The architecure design pattern being used in this project is MVVM,
or Model-View-ViewModel. In learning swiftUI for this app it appears
to be the most commonly used architecture for similar projects
to ours. The Model-View-ViewModel pattern helps to
separate the business and presentation logic of the app
from its user interface. The pattern makes the application easier
to program, maintain, and test. The MVVM pattern is similar to the
model-view-controller pattern, but it is more modular and easier to test.
